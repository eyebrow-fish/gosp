*Go* *S*tatic *P*ages is a small library which wraps around [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) to help display
static HTML pages.
Using this library helps remove some necessary boilerplate if you want to render HTML pages in [Go](https://go.dev/).

# goal

I don't think it's a big secret that many websites could probably be reduced down to a simple server-side rendered
service and actually gain big points in simplicity, maintainability, and speed. Which would mean that small projects
like this one could possibly help reduce on monstrously overcomplicated frontends move towards a simpler solution.
